When you want to do something complex, you'll need to delegate to an old fashioned React component. And to access external components, you'll need to use `import`.\n\nIf you're familiar with the JavaScript `import` statement then you already know how to use `import` in MDX; the syntax is identical.\n\nThe only difference between MDX and ES2015 `import` is MDX imports **must** appear before the first empty line, and must not contain any leading whitespace.\n\nSo for example, this MDX document starts with a valid `import` statement:\n\n<MDXBreadboard defaultSource={`\nimport { MDXBreadboard } from 'mdx-breadboard'\n\n*The import statement at the top of this example will be extracted from your content.*\n`} />\n\n<Warning>\nImport statements cannot have leading space!\n</Warning>\n\n<Warning>\nImport statements must appear at the top of the file. Any leading empty lines will cause the import to be treated as text.\n</Warning>\n\nFinally, all import statements must follow the form `import ... from \"...\"` or `import ... from '...'`. For example, the following *is not* an MDX import statement, as it does not contain any quotes:\n\n<MDXBreadboard defaultSource={`\nimport a moose from tasmania\n\n*The line at the top of this example will be part of your content.*\n`} />\n"}});
