It lets you `import` and use other Components within your Markdown. Like so:\n\n<MDXBreadboard defaultMode='view' defaultSource={`\nimport { MDXBreadboard } from 'mdx-breadboard'\n_Turtles?_\n<MDXBreadboard defaultSource='**Turtles!**' />\n`} />\n\n\nMDXC also lets you:\n\n- Use custom components to render code blocks, headings, etc.\n- Integrate Markdown links with react-router\n- Nest Markdown within JSX\n- `import` Markdown using Webpack\n- Use React `props` within Markdown\n- Use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) parser plugins\n\nTo see all this in action, try out some of the examples.\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n----------\n\nThis website is built with MDXC. In fact, once the page has loaded you can edit it live! Just click in the left pane -- or click the \"Source\" button if you're on a small screen -- and start typing!\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo start using MDX documents, you can either use the supplied command-line tool, you can use create-react-app, or you can configure Webpack with mdx-loader.\n\n\n### Command Line\n\n```bash\n# Install the `mdxc` command line tool using npm\nnpm install -g mdxc\n\n# Create a file with a single heading\necho '# Hello, World' > example.mdx\n\n# Output the compiled component to your console\nmdxc example.mdx\n\n# Call `mdxc --help` for more details\n> mdxc --help\n```\n\n### With create-react-app\n\nMDX can be used with unejected create-react-app projects! To start, you'll need to add a `.babelrc` file to the root level of your project:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-react-app\"]\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can import a component from any Markdown file by prepending the filename with `!babel-loader!mdx-loader!`. For example:\n\n```js\n/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */\nimport DocumentComponent from '!babel-loader!mdx-loader!../pages/index.md'\n```\n\nYou can also import documents dynamically using the proposed `import()` syntax. For an example of a statically rendered site using create-react-site and MDX, see [the source](https://github.com/jamesknelson/junctions/tree/master/site) for the [Junctions router site](https://junctions.js.org/tutorial/#Markdown-Components).\n\n\n\n### Webpack\n\nMDXC works great with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), allowing you to `import` and use your Markdown documents as React components. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport Document from './content/home.md'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Document />\n  document.getElementById('app')\n)\n```\n\n\nTo make this magic happen in an existing Webpack-based project, you'll need to install and configure [mdx-loader](http://github.com/jamesknelson/mdx-loader). Bearing in mind that MDXC outputs ES2015, you'll also want to run the result through Babel.\n\n\n\n```bash\n# Add mdx-loader to your project\nnpm install --save-dev mdx-loader\n```\n\nAssuming you're using Webpack 2, you'll then need to add an entry to your `module.rules` array:\n\n```js\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    /**\n     * MDX is a tool that converts Markdown files to React components. This \n     * loader uses MDX to create Page objects for Markdown files. As it\n     * produces ES2015, the result is then passed through babel.\n     */\n    { test: /\\.mdx?$/,\n      use: [\n        'babel-loader',\n        'mdx-loader',\n      ]\n    },\n\n    // ...\n  ]\n},\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nAt its core, MDXC is just a wrapper around the excellent and highly configurable [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) project. This means that its API is mostly the same.\n\nThe major difference is that the default renderer from markdown-it has been replaced with a non-configurable renderer. Existing markdown-it plugins will work, but any hooks on the renderer will silently fail. This is the behavior you want, as these hooks transform HTML strings, and MDXC doesn't use any HTML strings. If you need to transform the output, use factories instead.\n\nTo transform MDX into JavaScript, create an instance of the `MDXC` class and then call its `render` method. If you'd like to load any markdown-it plugins, call the `use` method on your `MDXC` instance before calling `render`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```js\nimport MDXC from 'mdxc'\n\nvar mdxc = new MDXC({\n  linkify: true,\n  typographer: true,\n})\n\nvar js = mdxc.render('# This is a heading')\n```\n\n\n\nThe options to `mdxc` are mostly the same as the options for markdown-it. For details, see the [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/) API docs.\n\nMDXC also provides a few extra options.\n\n- `commonJS` *bool* If true, your imports/exports will be transformed to use `require()` and `module.exports`\n- `unwrapped` *bool* If true, the component definition boilerplate will be omitted\n- `pragma` *string* Allows you to set the JSX pragma to something other than the default of `React.createElement`. Setting the pragma will stop mdxc from importing `React` by default.\n\n\n\nMDX in the wild\n---------------\n\n- [Junctions](https://junctions.js.org), a tool for handling navigation history within React applications\n- [React Armory](https://reactarmory.com)\n- *Add your site via PR!*\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nMad props to [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for doing the hard yards which make MDXC possible. Also, [markdown-it-jsx](https://github.com/osnr/markdown-it-jsx) provided the base for parsing JSX tags out of Markdown files. Finally, there would be no use making MDXC unless React, Webpack and Babel already existed.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nHelp is muchly appreciated! In particular, PRs for the following would be super duper great:\n\n- Improved tests\n- Refactoring existing code to be prettier and faster\n- Generating more concise JavaScript"}});
